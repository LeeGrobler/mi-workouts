2. Workout Routines: Organize your exercises into routines. Adjust the order of exercises with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.
3. Favorites: Highlight your preferred routines by marking them as favorites.
4. Cross-Device Sync: Sign up/in to store your data online, enabling you to access your routines and exercises from any device.
